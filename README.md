## Description
In this project, i recreated a website to show off my design resume . 
The goal was to keep the styling as similar as possible to the original site. I have made some changes however , to make the site more visually appealing and useful. Firstly i added a skills section , so employers can see what other skills i have. I also chaged the grid card layout of my work to have titles directly underneath(and also included a brief description) , as i believe that my original layout of having the titles offcenter and to the right might have made it more visually muddy and harder to read, especially for people with vision impairments. I also included hover animations for the navbar and contact me links.
I also compressed and resized images to achieve a faster loading
